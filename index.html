         <!--It has to be inside the closing brackets and spaces aren't allowed in img (My Image) you need to include %20 for adding space-->
         <p><strong>Am I Young?</strong> Yes, I am 18  years old and i'm turning 19 in April. I am from  Lebanon and I speak arabic.</p>
         
         <p>I chose to study in the Graphic Design  Program.</p> <em>Why?</em> <p>Because I want to learn  motion graphics and improve my design skills.  I've always been interested in it since I was  younger and my aunt inspired me to be one  because she was learning graphic design at the  time.</p>

        
         <p> My aunt gave me some advice back then and  it's something I still remember to this day.</p>
         <blockquote>
         <p> "My Graphic Design professors where very  strict about our projects that if they didn't  like them, they would rip our project in front  of us and tell us to redo it. My advice to you  is to not get sad if your teachers don't like  your work, they are preparing you for the real  world."</p>
